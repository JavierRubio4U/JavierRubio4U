# Javier Rubio â€” Senior Data Scientist

I built products at the intersection of **Telecom, ML, and Spatial Analytics**.  
I like shipping things that move real metrics: churn reduction, service degradation detection, smart capex planning, and location intelligence at scale.

- 10+ years applying **Machine Learning** & **software** to real products.  
- Background in **Telecommunications Engineering**; hands-on with **Python, PySpark, SQL, Spark**.  
- Comfortable across the stack: modeling, data pipelines, and lightweight apps/dashboards.

## Selected areas of work

**Currently:** Data Scientist in a Consumer Business Unit (CBU), focused on **churn propensity** and **early-warning triggers** for retention.

- **Churn propensity & retention** â€” probability models, survival/tenure analysis, uplift modeling for next-best-action, campaign targeting and measurement.
- **Early-warning triggers** â€” real-time signals from usage/quality/billing/tickets to flag likely churners; thresholds, drift monitoring, and alerting.
- **Customer analytics** â€” detractors/loyalty segmentation, NPS drivers, cohort & lifecycle analysis.
- **Network & service quality for CX** â€” degradation/incident signals mapped to customer impact to support retention.
- **Spatial insights (supporting)** â€” tiling/aggregations/choropleths when geography matters (market leakage, coverage vs churn hotspots).
