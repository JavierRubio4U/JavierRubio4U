# Javier Rubio — Senior Data Scientist

I built products at the intersection of **Telecom, ML, and Spatial Analytics**.  
I like shipping things that move real metrics: churn reduction, service degradation detection, smart capex planning, and location intelligence at scale.

- 10+ years applying **Machine Learning** & **software** to real products.  
- Background in **Telecommunications Engineering**; hands-on with **Python, PySpark, SQL, Spark**.  
- Comfortable across the stack: modeling, data pipelines, and lightweight apps/dashboards.

> I made this repo to keep my personal projects and notes. If you're short on time, jump to the pinned projects 👇

## Selected areas of work
- **Spatial analytics / Vodafone-style insights** — tiling, aggregations, and choropleths for decision-making.  
- **Customer analytics** — churners/detractors modeling, service-quality segmentation.  
- **Network & planning** — “smart capex” and degradation detection.  
- **IoT & visualization** — small middleware + dashboards to surface telemetry.
